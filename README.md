# AvisaAi-POO-APS

## Project Overview

AvisaAi-POO-APS is a software project developed as part of a university course on software analysis and design. The project emphasizes architectural aspects of the code, object-oriented programming (OOP), and the SOLID principles.

## Objectives

- Apply software design patterns and principles.
- Implement object-oriented programming concepts.
- Ensure code adheres to SOLID principles.
- Develop a maintainable and scalable software architecture.

## Features

- Modular design for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Use of design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, and Observer.
- Adherence to SOLID principles to ensure robust and flexible code.
- Comprehensive documentation and code comments for better understanding.
